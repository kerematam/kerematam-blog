It's been approximately 13 years, if not more, since I started my blog on Blogger, under the good old `blogspot.com` subdomain. Although it served its purpose well, it has become dated and no longer meets my needs. The time has come to transition to a better platform.

That's why I've migrated to Gatsby, a Static Site Generator (SSG) built on the React framework. It's well-documented, and most importantly (at least to me), it's fully customizable. Additionally, everything you would want from a blog is ready straight out of the box.

It is already super easy but, here my steps to do it:


* **Step 1: ** Grab the ready theme for blog: https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-theme-blog/

* **Step 2:** Learn about shadowing to customize:

Check the repo code:
https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog

* **Step 3** Check others work with same theme
