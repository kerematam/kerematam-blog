import CodeBlock0 from "./CodeBlock0.js"


As RxJS provides rich tooling for event-driven implementations, I've decided to give it a try by implementing the previous example of action handling hooks (useListener and useDispatcher) with it.

<CodeBlock0 />

This implementation have exactly same functionality with previous one. But since we have access to RxJS operators, we can do lot more with our actions:

import CodeBlock1 from "./CodeBlock1.js"

<CodeBlock1 />
